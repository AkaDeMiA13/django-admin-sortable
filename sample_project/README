Thanks for download django-admin-sortable.
I hope it can help you out as much on your project(s) as it does on mine :)

The only url patterns that are enabled for this project are /admin
The username/password is: admin/admin

I have not yet upgraded this sample application to use Django 1.5.
Please run this sample_project in a virtualenv and install dependencies
using the supplied requirements.txt via pip.

If you still need help, please contact me at: brandon@iambrandontaylor.com

Kind regards,
Brandon Taylor
